This list currently inolves [StevenBlacks combined list] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts) and [Windows Spy Blocker Extra list] (https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker/blob/master/data/simplewall/extra/blocklist.xml). reformatted to match Portmaster list requirements, adding this list uses an additional 41mb ram. Currently blocks 200,643 domains & 958 IP adresses.
